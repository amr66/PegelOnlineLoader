Example QGIS3 processing script to download data from https://www.pegelonline.wsv.de REST Service

poLoadStation.py is a processing script for qgis-3. It's more an example than a full featured tool. poLoadStation imports modules inside pomodules, so the real "work" is outsourced from the processing script.

Also the script can be run from a standalone pyqgis script, run_prosscript.py. It has some dependencies to mine system environment, so it be run out-of-the-box.
